Architect and builder of information processing systems.

I like:

* scalable, maintainable and reliable software
* test-driven development ([Ian Cooper style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM))
* domain-driven design
* [mono-environments](https://monoenv.tech/)
* pair programming
* metal 🤘🏻

Mostly Python by day and Clojure by night.
